\section{Introduction}

Finding the right internship is a critical step for university students seeking to gain practical experience and develop skills in their chosen fields. At the same time, companies offering internships need efficient ways to attract suitable candidates who match their requirements. The "Students\&Companies" (S\&C) platform is designed to address these needs by facilitating an efficient and effective matchmaking process between students and companies. Through S\&C, students can proactively search for internship opportunities that align with their skills, experiences, and career goals, while companies can advertise their offerings and connect with suitable candidates.\\ \\
The platform leverages various mechanisms to enhance this matching process. From simple keyword-based searching to advanced statistical analyses, S\&C aims to offer personalized recommendations, providing notifications to students about internships that meet their interests and alerting companies about potential candidates. Once a match is initiated, S\&C supports the selection process by coordinating interviews and structured assessments, ensuring that both parties have the tools needed to make informed decisions.\\ \\
Beyond matchmaking, S\&C collects valuable data from users, offering insights into ways to improve student CVs and company project descriptions. This feedback loop helps make the platform a dynamic environment that not only connects students with internships but also offers ongoing support to students, companies, and universities in monitoring the progress and quality of internships. Additionally, S\&C offers spaces for feedback, complaint management, and communication, enabling universities to oversee internship quality and address issues when necessary.\\ \\


\subsection{Purpose}

The primary objective of the Students\&Companies (S\&C) platform is to create an efficient and effective environment for connecting university students seeking internships with companies offering them. The platform is designed to serve both students and companies by addressing their specific needs through targeted functionalities. \\ \\
For students, S\&C provides the capability to proactively search for internships that match their skills, experiences, and aspirations. It allows them to explore a variety of opportunities while receiving personalized recommendations that align with their interests. The system further supports students by suggesting ways to improve their CVs to enhance their appeal to potential employers. \\ \\
For companies, S\&C offers a simple interface for publishing internship opportunities and accessing a diverse pool of student candidates. Companies benefit from receiving recommendations about students whose qualifications match their requirements, as well as having access to management tools that facilitate interviews and selection processes. \\ \\
The platform also incorporates mechanisms to collect and analyze feedback from students and companies, providing valuable insights that can help improve future internship placements. Universities, as another key stakeholder, can leverage the platform to monitor internship progress, address issues, and support students throughout their internship experiences. \\ \\
Below is a table that lists all the key goals of the S\&C platform:

\subsection{Scope}
The S\&C platform is a web-based solution that assists:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Students} in searching for internships that align with their skills and aspirations, providing mechanisms for submitting CVs and receiving internship recommendations.
    \item \textbf{Companies} in posting internships and finding suitable candidates based on the students’ profiles and skills.
    \item \textbf{Universities} in overseeing the internships, monitoring progress, addressing complaints, and ensuring the quality of the internship experiences.
\end{itemize}
The platform supports interactions between these three user groups and handles tasks such as matching students with internships, managing interviews, providing feedback, and analyzing the success of the internships. It is expected to scale for use across multiple universities and support thousands of students and companies.
