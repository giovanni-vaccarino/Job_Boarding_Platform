\section{Specific Requirements}

\subsection{External Interface Requirements}

\subsubsection{User Interfaces}

The system will provide a web-based user interface that caters to all user groupsâ€”students, companies, and universities. Each user group will have distinct interfaces designed to facilitate their respective roles. The interface must be intuitive and \todo{resp?}responsive, supporting a seamless user experience across both desktop and mobile devices.
\vspace{5mm}
\textbf{For Students:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dashboard Access}: Upon logging in, students will have access to a personalized dashboard displaying recommended internships, application statuses, and feedback from previous internships.
    \item \textbf{Profile Management}: The user interface will allow students to create and edit their profiles, including personal details, education history, work experience, and skills. It must support file uploads for CVs in common formats (PDF, DOCX) and provide real-time validation (e.g., checking required fields such as contact information, education, etc.).
    \item \textbf{Search Tools}: Students will have access to a powerful search tool to filter internships by criteria such as location, field of study, skills required, and compensation. The search interface will include advanced sorting options and keyword filters.
    \item \textbf{Application Process}: A step-by-step wizard will guide students through the process of applying for internships. The interface will show application deadlines, company requirements, and allow students to track their progress (e.g., application submitted, interview scheduled, etc.).
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}
\textbf{For Companies:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Internship Posting}: Companies will have a separate interface to create detailed internship postings. The interface will include fields for defining the role, required skills, compensation details, deadlines, and additional benefits.
    \item \textbf{Candidate Review}: Companies will have a dashboard that lists students who have applied for their internships, including a summary of the students' profiles and CVs. They can filter candidates based on keywords, required skills, and education level, and schedule interviews directly through the system. 
    \item \textbf{Recommendation Feed}: The interface will provide companies with a list of recommended candidates based on internship requirements, allowing them to invite students to apply.
\end{itemize} 
\vspace{5mm}
\textbf{For Universities:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Monitoring Dashboard}: Universities will have access to an administrative dashboard for overseeing the overall performance of internships, addressing complaints, and tracking student-company interactions. The dashboard will include a summary view of ongoing internships and flagged issues.
    \item \textbf{Complaint Management}: Universities will use a built-in tool to manage complaints lodged by students or companies. Administrators can log, track, and update complaint statuses through the interface, ensuring a transparent process for all parties involved.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}

The S\&C platform will be hosted on cloud infrastructure and accessible via standard web browsers. The platform will operate on servers capable of handling the load required by thousands of users, with no specific hardware requirements imposed on users other than internet-enabled devices, such as PCs, tablets, or smartphones.\\ \\
The cloud infrastructure must support horizontal dynamic scaling to handle peak loads efficiently, ensuring the system can respond to high traffic volumes (up to 10,000 concurrent users).

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}

--

\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}

The platform will use HTTPS for all communications to ensure secure data transmission between users and the system.\\ \\
Email notifications will be sent using industry-standard email protocols (SMTP) with TLS encryption to ensure secure communication. \\ \\
In addition, the platform will support push notifications for both web and mobile interfaces, ensuring that users are promptly notified of important actions (e.g., internship recommendations, interview scheduling) in real-time. \todo{DA FARE?}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Requirements}

\subsubsection{Number of Users}
The platform will be used by multiple parties, including students, companies, and universities. Based on market research, which includes a comparison with existing similar platforms such as the CareerService platform for Politecnico di Milano (Polimi) and other internship-matching services across Europe, we estimate that S\&C will attract approximately 20,000 students and 2,500 companies from various universities and industries. Additionally, around 50 universities will be actively using the platform to monitor internships. This gives us an estimated total user base of 22,550 users.\\ \\
Considering a worst-case scenario where 40\% of the users are active simultaneously, the system must support up to 9,020 concurrent users. The platform must ensure smooth operation, even during peak usage times.

\subsubsection{Data Storage}
The platform needs to store various types of data related to students, companies, internships, and the matchmaking process. Below are the estimated storage requirements for the first year of operation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Student data (profile)}: Each student will have a profile containing personal information such as name, contact details, and skillset. This profile data is estimated to require around 10 KB per student. Considering 20,000 students:
    \[
    20,000 \times 10 \, \text{KB} = 195.3 \, \text{MB}
    \]
    
    \item \textbf{Student data (PDF CVs)}: In addition to the basic profile information, each student is expected to upload their CV in PDF format. The average size of a CV in PDF format is estimated to be around 300 KB. Thus, for 20,000 students:
    \[
    20,000 \times 300 \, \text{KB} = 5.72 \, \text{GB}
    \]
    
    \item \textbf{Company data}: Each company will have a profile including company information, project descriptions, and internship offerings. Assuming 15 KB of storage per company profile and considering 2,500 companies:
    \[
    2,500 \times 15 \, \text{KB} = 36.6 \, \text{MB}
    \]
    
    \item \textbf{Internship postings}: Each internship posting will include information about the project, tasks, technologies, and terms (e.g., paid/unpaid). Assuming each posting requires 10 KB and that each company posts five internships a year:
    \[
    2,500 \times 5 \times 10 \, \text{KB} = 122.1 \, \text{MB}
    \]
    
    \item \textbf{Student feedback and internship outcomes}: Feedback data provided by students and companies will be stored for analysis. Assuming 5 KB per feedback submission and expecting each internship to receive three feedback entries, for 10,000 matched internships in the first year:
    \[
    10,000 \times 3 \times 5 \, \text{KB} = 146.5 \, \text{MB}
    \]
    
    \item \textbf{Interview and selection data}: Information about interviews, questionnaires, and selection processes will also be stored. Assuming 8 KB per interview record and that each company interviews an average of five candidates per internship:
    \[
    10,000 \times 5 \times 8 \, \text{KB} = 390.6 \, \text{MB}
    \]
\end{itemize}

Summing all storage requirements for the first year:
\[
195.3 \, \text{MB} + 5.72 \, \text{GB} + 36.6 \, \text{MB} + 122.1 \, \text{MB} + 146.5 \, \text{MB} + 390.6 \, \text{MB} = 6.6 \, \text{GB}
\]\\
Thus, a storage allocation of \textbf{10 GB} will be sufficient to accommodate the platform's data storage needs for a year, including room for growth and additional data generated by the system.


\subsubsection{Time Response}
Although there are no strict time requirements for the S\&C platform, it is important to maintain a responsive user experience. Reasonable average response times for key interactions could be as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Basic search queries and browsing operations should ideally be processed within \textbf{2 seconds}, to ensure a smooth navigation experience.
    \item More complex operations, such as generating personalized internship recommendations, should aim to complete within \textbf{5 seconds}, balancing the computational effort required with acceptable wait times for the user.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Constraints}

\subsubsection{Standards Compliance}

The platform must adhere to EU's GDPR regulations to ensure secure data storage and transmission, particularly when handling sensitive student and company data. All data interactions must comply with GDPR provisions regarding data ownership, user consent, and the right to access and delete data.

Additionally, the platform must comply with industry security standards to ensure the system is secure against potential threats.

\subsubsection{Hardware Limitations}

There are no specific hardware limitations imposed on end-users.

\subsection{Software System Attributes}

\subsubsection{Reliability}
The S\&C platform must be reliable to ensure continuous operation, even in the presence of faults. The system should be designed to be fault-tolerant to prevent the propagation of errors and ensure uninterrupted usability. Mechanisms such as automated failover and data redundancy should be in place to mitigate the risk of downtime due to unexpected failures.

\subsubsection{Availability}
The platform must be available as much as possible, with a minimum uptime of 99.999\%. Scheduled maintenance breaks should be minimized and, when necessary, performed during low-traffic periods (e.g., nighttime) to avoid disrupting critical usage, particularly around high-demand periods such as internship application deadlines.

\subsubsection{Security}
Security is critical for the S\&C platform, as it handles sensitive student and company data. The system must implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms. Authentication should ensure that users are properly identified before accessing the platform, while authorization should ensure that users can only perform actions they are permitted to.

\subsubsection{Maintainability}
The platform should be designed with scalability and modularity in mind to facilitate the easy addition of new features or modifications with minimal effort. The use of reusable code components and modular architecture will aid in making future updates efficient. Regular maintenance operations should be scheduled during times of low user activity, such as nighttime, to minimize disruptions to users.

\subsubsection{Portability}
The S\&C platform must be accessible from a wide range of web browsers, ensuring compatibility across all major platforms (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge). On the client side, the platform should support responsive design, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices. No specific portability requirements are imposed on the server side, provided the platform can run on common server configurations.
